# Prodigy Infotech Software Development Internship

This repository contains the micro-projects assigned by Prodigy Infotech during my internship in the software engineering domain. I was assigned five projects, out of which I have successfully completed four. Below are the details of each completed project:

## Completed Projects

### PRODIGY_SD_1: Temperature Conversion Program

**Description:**
This project involves writing a program to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's a fundamental exercise in understanding conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). It then converts the temperature to the other unit and displays the result.

**Key Features:**
- User input validation
- Conversion formulas:
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times C + 32 \)
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius: \( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32) \)
- Clear and user-friendly output

### PRODIGY_SD_2: Guessing Game

**Description:**
The guessing game is an interactive console-based application where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range depending on the chosen level (easy, medium, hard). The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low and counts the number of attempts.

**Key Features:**
- Random number generation
- Difficulty levels with different ranges:
  - Easy: 1-10
  - Medium: 1-50
  - Hard: 1-100
- Loop and conditional logic for user interaction
- Attempt counter and result display

### PRODIGY_SD_3: Simple Contact Management System

**Description:**
This project is a basic contact management system that allows users to add, view, and delete contacts. It provides practical experience in working with data structures and file handling. Contacts are stored in a CSV file, and the Python `pandas` library is used to handle the data operations.

**Key Features:**
- Add new contacts with details like name, phone number, and email
- View all contacts in a tabular format
- Delete contacts by name or phone number
- Data persistence using CSV file
- Efficient data manipulation with `pandas`

### PRODIGY_SD_4: Sudoku Solver

**Description:**
The Sudoku Solver project involves creating a program to solve Sudoku puzzles. It applies backtracking algorithms to fill in the empty cells in a Sudoku grid. The program can take a partially filled Sudoku board as input and outputs the solved board.

**Key Features:**
- Input validation for Sudoku grid
- Implementation of the backtracking algorithm
- Recursive function to solve the puzzle
- Display of the solved Sudoku board

## About the Internship

During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in various aspects of software development. Each project helped me improve my coding skills, understand different algorithms, and learn best practices in programming.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Let's connect and share ideas!
